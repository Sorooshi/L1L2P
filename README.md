Highlights:

- The first artificial intelligence-based solution with robust results to predict L1 from eye-fixation and demographic data of non-native English-speaking individuals

- The first artificial intelligence-based solution with robust results to predict L2P from eye-fixation and demographic data of non-native English-speaking individuals

- A comprehensive study of the performance and hyperparameter fine-tuning of five classifications/regression algorithms.

- Determining the importance of features in predicting L1/L2P using SHAP

- Introducing new data representations for training AI models using eye-fixation data

- Studying various assumptions on the informativeness of eye-fixation data for training AI models

- The "L1L2P" directory contains the source codes, testbeds, and data sets for training IID-based AI methods and
the windowed version of eye-fixation data (or the corresponding fused models)

- The "L1L2P_2D" directory contains the source codes, testbeds, and data sets for training AI methods using 
the scatter plot images.

- Poetry and pip installation will be added after the paper's acceptance
